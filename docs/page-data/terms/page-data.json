While limitations exist with models, we believe our Model offers a reasonable assessment of the typical performance of our historical investment selections for clients. Our Model is based on a taxable portfolio investing since the inception of the investment strategy in March 1999. The Model is presented net of all fees (adjusted to the highest annual fee charged to clients), brokerage expenses, and includes the reinvestment of dividends and interest. The Model generally reflects the performance of portfolios under management since the strategy’s inception in 1999. Client performance will deviate from the Model due to, among other reasons, the starting point of a client relationship; client guidelines, circumstances, and directives; the size of a portfolio and its relative costs; additions and withdrawals of funds; the timing and historical position sizing and concentration of investments; and the account type and its ability to participate in certain investments. During this period there were no strategies employed to obtain the results portrayed other than those implemented for clients pursuant to the Model and disclosed in our <i>Form ADV</i>. Please carefully review our <i>Form ADV</i> for further information. <i>We encourage and strongly recommend that you discuss with us the application, correlation, and significance of the Model’s performance to our client’s historical returns.</i> </p><p><b>Important Disclosure on Benchmark Comparison</b>: The S&amp;P Composite is regarded as a gauge of the US equity market. This index includes a representative sample of 500 leading companies in leading industries of the US economy. Although the S&amp;P 500 focuses on the large-cap segment of the market, we believe it serves as a reasonable proxy for the US market. Nonetheless, the use of the S&amp;P Composite as a comparison may not be appropriate for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, Model and client account(s) being more concentrated; volatile; holding cash, fixed income investments, and/or option contracts; being short securities; or the average capitalization of companies comprising the Index not correlating with the capitalization of the companies comprising the Model.</p><p></p>","blocks":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"a4a710c8-042c-5ce3-89bb-95b823e139c2","slug":"terms","__params":{"slug":"terms"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","header":"header"}}
