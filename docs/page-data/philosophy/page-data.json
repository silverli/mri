Adhering to this discipline creates our “edge.” We pride ourselves on being a hardworking, honest and results orientated partner who is always easily and readily accessible.</p><p>As contrarian “value” investors, we prefer to take the road less travelled. Not to be different, but because that is where an investor can truly have an edge.</p><p>Many investment managers have a short-term focus and are under intense pressure to perform in-line with benchmarks or indexes. As a result, events that may occur 3-5 years in the future have little utility to the typical portfolio manager.</p><p>We believe that extending one’s investment time horizon can materially reduce risk and help identify outsized investment opportunities. Over time our sense of long-term only seems to get longer.</p><p>Our sweet spot is finding misunderstood investments where near term issues cloud the long-term view. This allows us to compound capital for years to come, often in a tax advantaged manner.</p>","links":[{"id":"d76d7037-95b7-5814-b541-3bf42a0fef89","href":"/our-people","text":"Our People"}],"image":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"976b3852-dedf-5f6e-9ed3-b14463faa3d0","slug":"philosophy","__params":{"slug":"philosophy"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","header":"header"}}
